Yes you're right I do realize it's a Chinese company and I shouldn't expect anything else. I did try to experiment with the code. The comments you see in showUp() and showDown() are leftovers from the experiment. I converted the hex numbers to decimal to figure out what the heck is happening. Then changed a few of them, to no avail, and tried combining the two functions, also to no avail. Honestly it took me so long to realize that that's what those functions are doing... Initially I thought showUp is used to like pull a pin up and let the LCD know data is about to be written, or allow writing new data. And showDown is doing the opposite. I just don't know where else to begin experimenting.\n","I originally thought a was an index because not all of your data is showing up. but here you get the key element and the first element in the column zipped up.

Do you mean histogram?\n","If I interpret this correctly, you have a list of lists (`heatmap_data`) which are varying length, but contain only values between 0 and 23 (inclusive).\n","\n","For a heatmap, you want an array where each row is the counts for each value, i.e. the first column will be the number of 0s in each list (as the row). `np.vstack([np.unique(row, return_counts=True)[1] for row in heatmap_data])` will give you that. Then, just pass that into `sns.heatmap`.\n","Either the `CallHandler` should have a “public” API and be passed in to each `Employee` so they can register their intent to escalate their call or join the queue to take a new one (the logic for which should probably be handled by the `CallHandler`), or the employees should have a call state variable they can set, which gets regularly checked by the `CallHandler` to determine if the `Employee` call is over or needs to be escalated.\n","\n","The first approach is ‘interrupt-driven’, while the second approach is ‘poll-based’. There are different trade offs for each, in that interrupts are generally less demanding/more efficient to handle for the `CallHandler`, but may be a bit more complex to set up reasonably (and has less isolation from the `Employee` to the `CallHandler`), whereas polling is easy to understand but likely involves some wasted time checking the state of calls that are just ongoing, which also increases time before the next call can be assigned or escalated.\n","\n","Personally I’d be more inclined to go with the interrupt-based approach, because it’s more efficient, and as part of an organisation I don’t see it as a problem if the `Employee`s know that they’re working as a group, and have some direct mechanisms to do that efficiently. If there’s minimal trust of the employees then a poll-based system makes a little more sense, because it’s less reliant on them announcing that they’re done with a call before they can be assigned to a new one, but there’s still some trust required that they won’t falsify the ‘call state’ they present, and reduced efficiency in order to play ‘big brother’ seems expensive and unnecessary. \n","\n","I don’t think I’d bother with different classes for the `Employee` types - what extra functionality is provided? `Employee` could just have a `position` attribute (or similar).\n","Oh, you're right.

While I'm not an expert on numpy, I understand that it's basic premise is that it provides homogenous arrays - all the same type - and matrix operations to act on the whole array using C routines (i.e. compiled to machine code) which allows SIMD machine code instructions to be used. This is in contrast to what *normal* python objects do. There are a lot of overheads associated with higher level python data structures - they are not homogenous - they can be arbitrary types - and the code in them is *interpreted* and thus *much* slower.\n","\n","What you seem to be doing is using a numpy array like a Python classic list of lists, and obliterating the performance boost as a result. What you need to do to gain the performance offered by numpy is store the data in basic numeric data types, and use numpy array operations on the whole array, rather than looping through with python *for* loops. It seems to me that you are not really getting any benefit from numpy by using it this way, but however, it may also be that your problem is not amenable to solving using numpy - but don't take my
